## Overview
This README file provides information about the RAT (Remote Access Trojan) tool. The RAT tool is a malicious software that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a victim's computer. It provides the attacker with remote control over the victim's system, enabling them to perform various actions such as viewing files, capturing keystrokes, taking screenshots, and more.

## Features
- Establishes a connection between the attacker's computer and the victim's computer.
- Executes commands received from the attacker.
- Sends the output of executed commands back to the attacker.
- Provides remote control over the victim's system.

## Usage
1. Replace `"attacker_ip"` in the code with the IP address of the attacker's computer.
2. Run the RAT tool on the victim's computer.
3. The attacker can now send commands to the victim's computer through the established connection.
4. The RAT tool will execute the commands and send the output back to the attacker.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Open the code file in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice.
3. Replace `"attacker_ip"` with the IP address of the attacker's computer.
4. Save the changes and run the code.

## Dependencies
This RAT tool requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- socket module
- subprocess module
